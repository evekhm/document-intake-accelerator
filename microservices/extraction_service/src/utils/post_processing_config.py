This is a config file for post-processing script.
If the user wants to post process any extracted
    field value he can make changes to this file.
The post processing script handles the following:
1. Cleans any noise in the extracted value.
2. Converts a value to its upper case
3. Converts a value to its lower case.
3. Change date format.
4. Removes extra spaces in extracted value.
5. Corrects extracted value to string.
6. Corrects extracted value to number.

For date formats user can use below symbols:
%d Day of the month as a zero-padded decimal number eg.01, 02, …, 31
%b Month as locale’s abbreviated name eg.Jan, Feb, …, Dec (en_US);
%B Month as locale’s full name eg.January, February, …, December (en_US);
%m Month as a zero-padded decimal number eg:01, 02, …, 12
%y Year without century as a zero-padded decimal number eg:00, 01, …, 99
%Y Year with century as a decimal number eg:0001, 0002, …,
2013, 2014, …, 9998, 9999
eg: 03/04/2022 is '%m/%d/%y'
