# Document Intake Accelerator

> A pre-packaged and customizable solution to accelerate the development of end-to-end document processing workflow incorporating Document AI parsers and other GCP products (Firestore, BigQuery, GKE, etc). The goal is to accelerate the development efforts in document workflow with many ready-to-use components.

## Key features
- End-to-end workflow management: document classification, extraction, validation, profile matching and Human-in-the-loop review.
- API endpoints for integration with other systems.
- Customizable components in microservice structure.
- Solution architecture with best practices on Google Cloud Platform.

## Getting Started to Deploy the DocAI Workflow

Following steps could be run either from the CLoud Shell of the Project or locally,

When running locally, following tools need to be installed in advance:
* skaffold (tested with v2.0.2)
* gcloud
* kubectl
* terraform (tested with Terraform v1.3.5)
* python

Also make sure to update to the latest gcloud tool:
```
# Tested with gcloud v400.0.0
gcloud components update
```

Before starting, activate Python virtual env in your terminal:
```shell
python3 -m venv ~/venv/pa
source ~/venv/pa/bin/activate
```

### Prerequisites
To access Custom Document Classifier and Splitter, you need to request early access by filling in this form: 
This needs to be done before running the deployment.

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (It is recommended to deploy two projects: one for the Pipeline Engine, and another for the Document AI processors. Both projects need to belong in the same Org. )

[//]: # (When following this  practice, first create project used to host Document AI. Then create second project for deployment. Otherwise, when both DocAI and Pipeline deployed into the same project, use same PROJECT_ID in the commands below.)

*Important*: User needs to have Project **owner** role in order to deploy  terraform setup.
```
export PROJECT_ID=<GCP Project ID to host Data ingestion microservices>
export API_DOMAIN=mydomain.com
```
Note, If you do not have a custom domain, leave a dummy one `mydomain.com` (needs to be set to a legal name as a placeholder) and then later run an optional step below to configure using Ingress IP address instead.


Activate Project for the pipeline deployment:
```shell
gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID
```

Run following commands when deploying from developer machine  (not required for Cloud Shell):
```shell
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth application-default login
gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project $PROJECT_ID
```

### GCP Organization policy

Run the following commands to update Organization policies (Required for managed environments such as Argolis):
```
ORGANIZATION_ID=$(gcloud organizations list --format="value(name)")
gcloud resource-manager org-policies disable-enforce constraints/compute.requireOsLogin --organization=$ORGANIZATION_ID
gcloud resource-manager org-policies delete constraints/compute.vmExternalIpAccess --organization=$ORGANIZATION_ID
gcloud resource-manager org-policies delete constraints/compute.requireShieldedVm --organization=$ORGANIZATION_ID
```

If you have multiple Organizations, set the ORGANIZATION_ID manually to the Organization ID

Or, change the following Organization policy constraints in [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/orgpolicies)
- constraints/compute.requireOsLogin - Enforced Off
- constraints/compute.vmExternalIpAccess - Allow All
- constraints/compute.requireShieldedVm - Enforced Off

### Setup and Run Demo

Simplified steps below makes installation faster by encapsulating details in the wrapper scripts.
For the detailed original flow see [Detailed Steps](#steps_original.md).

#### Terraform 
Run init step (will prepare for terraform execution and do terraform apply with auto-approve):
```shell
./init.sh
```

Get the API endpoint IP address, this will be used in Firebase Auth later.
```
kubectl describe ingress default-ingress | grep Address

```
- This will print the Ingress IP like below:
  ```
  Address: 123.123.123.123
  ```

**NOTE**: If you don’t have a custom domain ( (if you left `mydomain.com` above as API_DOMAIN), and want to use the Ingress IP address as the API endpoint:
- Change the API_DOMAIN to the Ingress endpoint, and re-deploy CloudRun.
  ```
  export API_DOMAIN=$(kubectl describe ingress default-ingress | grep Address | awk '{print $2}')
  source ./init_domain_with_ip.sh
  ```

#### Enable Firebase Auth
- Before enabling firebase, make sure [Firebase Management API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/firebase.googleapis.com/metrics) should be disabled in GCP API & Services.
- Go to [Firebase Console UI](https://console.firebase.google.com/) to add your existing project. Select “Pay as you go” and Confirm plan.
- On the left panel of Firebase Console UI, go to Build > Authentication, and click Get Started.
- Select Google in the Additional providers
- Enable Google auth provider, and select Project support email to your admin’s email. Leave the Project public-facing name as-is. Then click Save.
- Go to Settings > Authorized domain, add the following to the Authorized domains:
  - Web App Domain (e.g. adp-dev.cloudpssolutions.com) - or empry, if you do not have a custom domain. 
  - API endpoint IP address (from kubectl describe ingress | grep Address)
  - localhost
- Go to Project Overview > Project settings, you will use this info in the next step.
- In the codebase, open up microservices/adp_ui/.env in an Editor (e.g. VSCode), and change the following values accordingly.
  - REACT_APP_BASE_URL
    - The custom Web App Domain that you added in the previous step.
    - Alternatively, you can use the API Domain IP Address (Ingress), e.g. http://123.123.123.123
  - REACT_APP_API_KEY - Web API Key
  - REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN - $PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com
  - REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET - $PROJECT_ID.appspot.com
  - REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
    - You can find this ID in the Project settings > Cloud Messaging
  - (Optional) REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID - Google Analytics ID, only available when you enabled the GA with Firebase.

Optional: [register you domain](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/tutorials/create-domain-tutorial) 
#### Deploy microservices
```shell
./deploy.sh
```

### Out of the box Demo Flow

#### Working from the UI
In order to access the Application UI, Navigate to the API Domain IP Address or Domain Name (depending on the setup) in the browser and login with your Google credentials.
Try Uploading the Document, using *Upload a Document* button.  From *Choose Program* drop-down, select a state ( pick any ).
Right now, the Form Processor is set up as a default processor (since no classifier is deployed or trained), so each document will be processed with the Form Parser and extracted data will be streamed to the BigQuery.

> The setting for the default processor is done through the following configuration setting  "settings_config" -> "classification_default_label".  Explained in details in the [Configuring the System](#system_config).

As you click Refresh Icon on the top right, you will see different Status the Pipeline goes through: *Classifying -> Extracting -> Approved* or *Needs Review*. 

If you select *View* action, you will see the key/value pairs extracted from the Document. 

Navigate to BigQuery and check for the extracted data inside `validation` dataset and `validation_table`.

You could also run sample query from the Cloud Shell:
```shell
./sql-scripts/run_query.sh
```

#### Triggering pipeline in a batch mode
*NB: Currently only pdf documents are supported, so if you have a jpg or png, please first convert it to pdf.*

The Pipeline is triggered when an empty file named START_PIPELINE is uploaded to the `${PROJECT_ID}-pa-forms` GCS bucket. When the START_PIPELINE document is uploaded, all `*.pdf` files containing in that folder are sent to the processing queue.  
All documents within the same gsc folder are treated as related documents, that belong to the same application (patient).
When processed, documents are copied to `gs://${PROJECT_ID}-document-upload` with unique identifiers.

Wrapper script to upload each document as a standalone application inside `${PROJECT_ID}-pa-forms`:
```shell
./start_pipeline.sh -d <local-dir-with-forms>  -l <batch-name>
```

Or send all documents within the directory as single Application with same Case ID:
```shell
./start_pipeline.sh -d <local-dir-with-forms> -l <batch-name> -p
```

Or send a pdf document by name:
```shell
 ./start_pipeline.sh -d <local-dir-with-forms>/<my_doc>.pdf  -l <batch-name>
```

Alternatively, send a single document to processing:
- Upload *pdf* form to the gs://<PROJECT_ID>-pa-forms/<mydir> bucket and 
- Drop empty START_PIPELINE file to trigger the pipeline execution.
> After putting START_PIPELINE, the pipeline is automatically triggered  to process  all PDF documents inside the gs://${PROJECT_ID}-pa-forms/<mydir> folder.

```shell
gsutil cp  <my-local-dir>/<my_document>.pdf
gsutil cp START_PIPELINE gs://${PROJECT_ID}-pa-forms/<my-dir>/
touch START_PIPELINE
gsutil cp START_PIPELINE gs://${PROJECT_ID}-pa-forms/<my-dir>/
```

## Setting up CDE and CDS 

**Pre-requisites** 
- There should be at least 20 (recommended 50) customer  forms with filled data (of the same type), which could be used for training the processor for extraction and classification.
- All forms need to be in pdf format


If you have png files, following script can convert them to pdf:
```shell
python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow
python utils/fake_data_generation/png2pdf.py -d sample_data/<input-dir> -o sample_data/<output_pdf_dir>
```

### Custom Document Extractor
The Custom Document Extractor has already been deployed, but not yet trained. The steps need to be done manual and via the UI.
- Manually Configure and [Train Custom Document Extractor](https://cloud.google.com/document-ai/docs/workbench/build-custom-processor) (currently it is deployed but not pre-trained)
  - Using UI Manually Label and Train Custom Document Extractor to recognize selected type of the PriorAuth forms.
  - Set a default revision for the processor.
  - Test extraction by manually uploading document via the UI and check how entities are being extracted and assigned labels.

You can deploy and train additional Custom Document Extractor if you navigate to **Document AI -> Workbench** and select **Custom Document Extractor** -> CREATE PROCESSOR

### Custom Document Classifier
Classifier allows mapping the document class to the processor required for data extraction. 

Configure Custom Document Classifier (Currently feature is not available for GA and needs to be requested via the [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfDuC9bGyEwnseEYIC3I2LvNjzz-XZ2n1RS4X5pnIk2eSbk3A/viewform))
  - After Project has been whitelisted for using Classifier, navigate to **Document AI -> Workbench**  and select **Custom Document Classifier** -> CREATE PROCESSOR.
  - Create New Labels for each document type you plan to use.  
  - Train Classifier using sample forms to classify the labels.
  - Deploy the new trained version via the UI.
  - Set the new version as default and test it manually via the UI by uploading the test document. is it classified properly?

> If you have just one sample_form.pdf, and you want to use it for classifier, use following utility to copy same form into the gcs bucket, later to use for classification. At least 10 instances are needed (all for Training set).
```shell
utils/copy_forms.sh -f sample_data/<path_to_form>.pdf -d gs://<path_to_gs_uri> -c 10
```

## <a name="system_config"></a>Configuring the System
- Config file is stored in the GCS bucket and dynamically used by the pipeline: `gs://${PROJECT_ID}-config/config.json`


  - For the config changes, download, edit, and upload the  `gs://${PROJECT_ID}-config/config.json` file:

    ```shell
    gsutil cp "gs://${PROJECT_ID}-config/config.json" common/src/common/configs/config.json 
    ```

  - Apply required changes as discussed later in this section. 

  - Upload config:
    ```shell
    gsutil cp common/src/common/configs/config.json "gs://${PROJECT_ID}-config/config.json"

### Adding Classifier 
Since currently Classifier is not in GA and has to be manually created, following section needs to be added inside  `parser_config` to activate Classification step (replace  <PROJECT_ID> and <PROCESSOR_ID> accordingly):

```shell
"parser_config": {
    # ... parsers here ...
    
    "classifier": {
      "location": "us",
      "parser_type": "CUSTOM_CLASSIFICATION_PROCESSOR",
      "processor_id": "projects/<PROJECT_ID>/locations/us/processors/<PROCESSOR_ID>"
    }
  }
```


### Adding Support for Additional Type of Forms

1. Deploy and train the DocAI  processor.


2. After processor is created and deployed, add following entry (replace <parser_name> with the name which best describes the processor purpose)  inside `parser_config`:
```shell
"parser_config": {
    # ... parsers here ...
      
    "<parser_name>": {
      "processor_id": "projects/<PROJECT_ID>/locations/us/processors/<PROCESSOR_ID>"
    }
}
```

3. Add configuration for the document type entry inside `document_types_config`:

```shell
"document_types_config": {
     # ... document configurations here ... 
     
    "<document_type_name>": {
        "doc_type": "supporting_documents",
        "display_name": "<Name of the Form>",
        "classifier_label": "<Label-as-trained>",
        "parser": "<parser_name>"
    }  
}

```
Where:
- **doc_type** - Can be of "application_form" or "supporting_documents".
- **display_name** - Text to be displayed in the UI for the 'Choose Document Type/Class' drop-down when manually Re-Classifying.
- **classifier_label** - As defined in the Classifier when training on the documents.
- **parser** - Parser name as defined in the `parser_config` section.

### General Settings
`settings_config` section currently supports the following parameters:

- `extraction_confidence_threshold` - threshold to mark documents for HITL as *Needs Review*. Compared with the *calculated average* confidence score across all document  labels. 
- `field_extraction_confidence_threshold` - threshold to mark documents for HITL as *Needs Review*. Compared with the *minimum* confidence score across all document labels.
- `classification_confidence_threshold` - threshold to pass Classification step. When the confidence score as returned by the Classifier is less, the default behavior is determined by the `classification_default_class` setting. If the settings is "None" or non-existing document type, document remain *Unclassified*. 
- `classification_default_class` - the default behavior for the unclassified forms (or when classifier is not configured). Needs to be a valid  name of the document type, as configured in the `document_types_config`.


## Cross-Project Setup
If you want to enable cross project access, following steps need to be done manually.

Limitations: Two projects need to be within the same ORG. 
For further reference, lets define the two projects:
- GCP Project to run the Claims Data Activator - Engine (**Project CDA**)
- GCP Project to train and serve Document AI Processors and Classifier  (**Project DocAI**)

1) Inside Project DocAI [add](https://medium.com/@tanujbolisetty/gcp-impersonate-service-accounts-36eaa247f87c) following service account of the Project CDA `gke-sa@{PROJECT_CDA_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com` (used for GKE Nodes) and grant following  [roles](https://cloud.google.com/document-ai/docs/access-control/iam-roles):
   - **Document AI Viewer** - To grant access to view all resources and process documents in Document AI
   Where `{PROJECT_CDA_ID}` - to be replaced with the ID of the Project CDA
2) Inside Project CDA grant following permissions to the default Document AI service account of the Project DocAI: `service-{PROJECT_DOCAI_NUMBER}@gcp-sa-prod-dai-core.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
   - **Storage Object Viewer** - [To make files in Project CDA accessible to Project DocAI](https://cloud.google.com/document-ai/docs/cross-project-setup) (This could be done on the `${PROJECT_CDA_ID}-pa-forms` bucket level with the forms to handle).
   - **Storage Object Admin**  - To allow DocAI processor to save extracted entities as json files inside `${PROJECT_CDA_ID}-output` bucket of the Project CDA  (This could be done on the `${PROJECT_CDA_ID}-output` bucket level).
   Where `{PROJECT_DOCAI_NUMBER}` - to be replaced with the Number of the Project DocAI

## Rebuild / Re-deploy Microservices

Updated sources from the Git repo:
```shell
git pull
```
The following wrapper script will use skaffold to rebuild/redeploy microservices:
```shell
./deploy.sh
```

You can additionally [clear all existing data (in GCS, Firestore and BigQuery)](#cleaning_data) 


# Utilities
## Prerequisites
Make sure to install all required libraries prior to using utilities listed below: 
```shell
pip3 install -r utils/requirements.tx
```
## Testing Utilities
- Following utility would be handy to list all the entities the Trained processor Could extract from the document:

  ```shell
  export RPOCESSOR_ID=<your_processor_id>
  python utils/gen_config_processor.py -f <my-local-dir>/<my-sample-form>.pdf 
  ```

## <a name="cleaning_data"></a>Cleaning Data

Make sure to first install dependency libraries for utilities:
```shell
pip3 install -r utils/requirements.tx
```

- Following script cleans all document related data (requires PROJECT_ID to be set upfront as an env variable):
  - Firestore `document` collection
  - BigQuery `validation` table
  - `${PROJECT_ID}-pa-forms` bucket
  - `${PROJECT_ID}-document-upload` bucket
  
  ```shell
  utils/cleanup.sh
  ```
  
> Please, note, that due to active StreamingBuffer, BigQuery can only be cleaned after a table has received no inserts for an extended interval of time (~ 90 minutes). Then the buffer is detached and DELETE statement is allowed.
> For more details see [here](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/bigquery/life-of-a-bigquery-streaming-insert) .

# Configuration Service
Config Service (used by adp ui):
- http://$API_DOMAIN/config_service/v1/get_config?name=document_types_config
- http://$API_DOMAIN/config_service/v1/get_config

## Deployment Troubleshoot

### Terraform Troubleshoot

#### App Engine already exists
```
│ Error: Error creating App Engine application: googleapi: Error 409: This application already exists and cannot be re-created., alreadyExists
│
│   with module.firebase.google_app_engine_application.firebase_init,
│   on ../../modules/firebase/main.tf line 3, in resource "google_app_engine_application" "firebase_init":
│    3: resource "google_app_engine_application" "firebase_init" {
```

**Solution**: Import the existing project in Terraform:
```
cd terraform/environments/dev
terraform import module.firebase.google_app_engine_application.firebase_init $PROJECT_ID

```

### CloudRun Troubleshoot

The CloudRun service “queue” is used as the task dispatcher from listening to Pub/Sub “queue-topic”
- Go to CloudRun logging to see the errors

### Frontend Web App

- When opening up the ADP UI for the first time, you’ll see the HTTPS not secure error, like below:
```
Your connection is not private
```

- Open the chrome://net-internals/#hsts in URL, and delete the domain HSTS.
- (Optional) Click the “Not Secure” icon on the top, and select the “Certificate is not valid” option, and select “Always Trust”.


# Development

### Prerequisites

Install required packages:

- For MacOS:
  ```
  brew install --cask skaffold kustomize google-cloud-sdk
  ```

- For Windows:
  ```
  choco install -y skaffold kustomize gcloudsdk
  ```

* Make sure to use __skaffold 1.24.1__ or later for development.

### Initial setup for local development
After cloning the repo, please set up for local development.

* Export GCP project id and the namespace based on your Github handle (i.e. user ID)
  ```
  export PROJECT_ID=<Your Project ID>
  export SKAFFOLD_NAMESPACE=<Replace with your Github user ID>
  export REGION=us-central1
  ```
* Log in gcloud SDK:
  ```
  gcloud auth login
  ```
* Run the following to set up critical context and environment variables:
  ```
  ./setup/setup_local.sh
  ```
  This shell script does the following:
  - Set the current context to `gke_autodocprocessing-demo_us-central1_default_cluster`. The default cluster name is `default_cluster`.
    > **IMPORTANT**: Please do not change this context name.
  - Create the namespace $SKAFFOLD_NAMESPACE and set this namespace for any further kubectl operations. It's okay if the namespace already exists.

### Build and run all microservices in the default GKE cluster

> **_NOTE:_**  By default, skaffold builds with CloudBuild and runs in GKE cluster, using the namespace set above.

To build and run in cluster:
```
skaffold run --port-forward
```

### Build and run all microservices in Develompent mode with live reload

To build and run in cluster with hot reload:
```
skaffold dev --port-forward
```
- Please note that any change in the code will trigger the build process.

### Build and run with a specific microservice

```
skaffold run --port-forward -m <Microservice>
```

You can also run multiple specific microservices altogether. E.g.:

```
skaffold run --port-forward -m sample-service,other-service
```

### Build and run microservices with a custom Source Repository path
```
skaffold dev --default-repo=<Image registry path> --port-forward
```

E.g. you can point to a different GCP Cloud Source Repository path:
```
skaffold dev --default-repo=gcr.io/another-project-path --port-forward
```

### Run with local minikube cluster

Install Minikube:

```
# For MacOS:
brew install minikube

# For Windows:
choco install -y minikube
```

Make sure the Docker daemon is running locally. To start minikube:
```
minikube start
```
- This will reset the kubectl context to the local minikube.

To build and run locally:
```
skaffold run --port-forward

# Or, to build and run locally with hot reload:
skaffold dev --port-forward
```

Optionally, you may want to set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` manually to a local JSON key file.
```
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=<Path to Service Account key JSON file>
```

### Deploy to a specific GKE cluster

> **IMPORTANT**: Please change gcloud project and kubectl context before running skaffold.

Replace the `<Custom GCP Project ID>` with a specific project ID and run the following:
```
export PROJECT_ID=<Custom GCP Project ID>

# Switch to a specific project.
gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID

# Assuming the default cluster name is "default_cluster".
gcloud container clusters get-credentials default_cluster --zone us-central1-a --project $PROJECT_ID
```

Run with skaffold:
```
skaffold run -p custom --default-repo=gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID

# Or run with hot reload and live logs:
skaffold dev -p custom --default-repo=gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID
```

### Build and run microservices with a different Skaffold profile
```
# Using custom profile
skaffold dev -p custom --port-forward

# Using prod profile
skaffold dev -p prod --port-forward
```

### Skaffold profiles

By default, the Skaffold YAML contains the following pre-defined profiles ready to use.

- **dev** - This is the default profile for local development, which will be activated automatically with the Kubectl context set to the default cluster of this GCP project.
- **prod** - This is the profile for building and deploying to the Prod environment, e.g. to a customer's Prod environment.
- **custom** - This is the profile for building and deploying to a custom GCP project environments, e.g. to deploy to a staging or a demo environment.

### Useful Kubectl commands

To check if pods are deployed and running:
```
kubectl get po

# Or, watch the live update in a separate terminal:
watch kubectl get po
```

To create a namespace:
```
kubectl create ns <New namespace>
```

To set a specific namespace for further kubectl operations:
```
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=<Your namespace>
```

## Code Submission Process

### For the first-time setup:
* Create a fork of a Git repository
  - Go to the specific Git repository’s page, click Fork at the right corner of the page:
* Choose your own Github profile to create this fork under your name.
* Clone the repo to your local computer. (Replace the variables accordingly)
  ```
  cd ~/workspace
  git clone git@github.com:$YOUR_GITHUB_ID/$REPOSITORY_NAME.git
  cd $REPOSITORY_NAME
  ```
  - If you encounter permission-related errors while cloning the repo, follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) to create and add an SSH key for Github access (especially when checking out code with git@github.com URLs)
* Verify if the local git copy has the right remote endpoint.
  ```
  git remote -v
  # This will display the detailed remote list like below.
  # origin  git@github.com:jonchenn/$REPOSITORY_NAME.git (fetch)
  # origin  git@github.com:jonchenn/$REPOSITORY_NAME.git (push)
  ```

  - If for some reason your local git copy doesn’t have the correct remotes, run the following:
    ```
    git remote add origin git@github.com:$YOUR_GITHUB_ID/$REPOSITORY_NAME.git
    # or to reset the URL if origin remote exists
    git remote set-url origin git@github.com:$YOUR_GITHUB_ID/$REPOSITORY_NAME.git
    ```

* Add the upstream repo to the remote list as **upstream**.
  ```
  git remote add upstream git@github.com:$UPSTREAM_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
  ```
  - In default case, the $UPSTREAM_REPOSITORY_NAME will be the repo that you make the fork from.


### When making code changes

* Sync your fork with the latest commits in upstream/master branch. (more info)
  ```
  # In your local fork repo folder.
  git checkout -f master
  git pull upstream master
  ```

* Create a new local branch to start a new task (e.g. working on a feature or a bug fix):
  ```
  # This will create a new branch.
  git checkout -b feature_xyz
  ```

* After making changes, commit the local change to this custom branch and push to your fork repo on Github. Alternatively, you can use editors like VSCode to commit the changes easily.
  ```
  git commit -a -m 'Your description'
  git push
  # Or, if it doesn’t push to the origin remote by default.
  git push --set-upstream origin $YOUR_BRANCH_NAME
  ```
  - This will submit the changes to your fork repo on Github.

* Go to your Github fork repo web page, click the “Compare & Pull Request” in the notification. In the Pull Request form, make sure that:
  - The upstream repo name is correct
  - The destination branch is set to master.
  - The source branch is your custom branch. (e.g. feature_xyz in the example above.)
  - Alternatively, you can pick specific reviewers for this pull request.

* Once the pull request is created, it will appear on the Pull Request list of the upstream origin repository, which will automatically run tests and checks via the CI/CD.

* If any tests failed, fix the codes in your local branch, re-commit and push the changes to the same custom branch.
  ```
  # after fixing the code…
  git commit -a -m 'another fix'
  git push
  ```
  - This will update the pull request and re-run all necessary tests automatically.
  - If all tests passed, you may wait for the reviewers’ approval.

* Once all tests pass and get approvals from reviewer(s), the reviewer or Repo Admin will merge the pull request back to the origin master branch.

### (For Repo Admins) Reviewing a Pull Request
For code reviewers, go to the Pull Requests page of the origin repo on Github.

* Go to the specific pull request, review and comment on the request.
branch.
* Alternatively, you can use Github CLI `gh` to check out a PR and run the codes locally: https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_pr_checkout
* If all goes well with tests passed, click Merge pull request to merge the changes to the master.

Test for PR changes

### (For Developers) Microservices Assumptions
* app_registration_id used on the ui is referred as case_id in the API code
* case_id is referred as external case_id in the firestore
